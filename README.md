# liri-node-app
The CLI app gathers media information based on user input and displays that information back to the user.
<br>
My Liri app takes the users inputs to display media information. Specific search inputs are for movies, songs/artists, and venues for bands. If there is no input there are defaults in place with pre determined information.

## Directions:
###### In one line of Code-
* 1. Type node
* 2. Type file name "liri.js
* 3. What to search for type the following: 
    * 3a. Artists/Songs: spotify-this-song "name of artist or song"
    * 3b. Movie information: movie-this "movie title or actor"
    * 3c. Band Venues: concert-this "name of Artist"
